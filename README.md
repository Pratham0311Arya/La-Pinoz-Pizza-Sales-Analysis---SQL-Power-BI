# La Pinoz Pizza Sales Analysis
## Introduction
In this project, I conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for a pizza store with over 50,000 records to extract valuable insights from the available data. Initially, I employed traditional analytical methods, followed by the utilization of Power BI to craft interactive dashboards for enhanced visualization and exploration.

## Insights 
- Identifying the top-selling pizza varieties.
- Determining the most lucrative weekday with highest sales.
- Analyzing sales trends on a daily and monthly basis.
- Ranking pizzas based on order frequency.
- Projecting sales for the upcoming two months.
- And so forth.
